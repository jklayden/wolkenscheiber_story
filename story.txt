Once upon a time, in the small town of Raesfeld, there lived a man who enjoyed peaceful walks through the village.
One day, he was passing by a new baeckerei (bakery) and decided he would go inside. 
He could smell the fresh gebaecks inside and was feeling a little bit hungry. 
As he entered, the cool breeze from the Klimaanlage greeted him, offering a pleasant escape from the warm afternoon sun.
He browsed for a moment, then finally decided he would buy an apfelkuchen.
All of a sudden, a hund came sprinting in and stole the apfelkuchen from the mans clutches.
The man, confused and frustrated, started to chase after the mischeivvous hund down the Huptstrasses towards Schloss Eltz, but he couldn't run as fast as he'd like, due to his tight Lederhosen.
Thus, he tripped into the hauptstrasse, and turned his head to see a BMW quickly turning the corner, blasting Rammstein's newest album as they got closer.
He then started to dance, and danced so so wildly that his Lederhosen ripped right down the middle, causing the onlookers to burst into laughter as the BMW sped off.
Embarassed, he ran into the nearest store to find a coverup, but all he could find was a dirndel, and with no choice, he put it on and returned to the hauptstrasse.
Returning to the baeckerei, he endeavored to get a new gebaeck.
